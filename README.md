# Seca

Description:
Seca is a text based game where you try to escape a haunted hotel. In the beginning of the game, the player learns that they are trapped
on the top floor and must escape ASAP!! However the elevators are haunted as well and has to make a stop on every floor. There are 13 
floors and each one has a challenge one being worse than the first. The user will be asked a question and for every level they pass, the
questions will begin to get harder. All of these questions will be based on the famous show “Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?” . 
The questions will consist of math, language, history, and science ranging from first to 5th grade problems. All of the questions will be 
multiple choice and to enter their answer, the user will type in a,b,c or d. The user has 2 lives, meaning out of the 13 problems, they 
can get 2 wrong. If they fail to get 11 or more correct they will meet a game over scene however if they do succeed, a congratulation 
page will show. 

How to play: 
The game will ask you a question and you have to enter the correct answer to pass the round or level. For the each yes or no round you have
to enter 1 for yes and 0 for no. Otherwise just enter the answer to the equation.

Special Features:
1) My game has a feature where the player gets 2 lives. This means that they are able to get 2 problems wrong while still being able to win 
the game.
2) There are a lot of enemies in the game. The boss level are a bunch of BTS fans. To escape past them you have to answer a question 
related to BTS.
